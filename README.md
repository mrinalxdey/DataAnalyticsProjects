# DataAnalyticsProjects

This is a project that helped me practice what I have learnt till now relating to Data Analytics. <br>
## I started with Data Exploration on the Covid-19 data which was made publicly available by ourworldindata.org. <br>
I have performed some queries which shows a variety of comparisons between the existing population and the effects of Covid-19 on the population. Effects such as rate of infection and death, the number of people affected, the number of people vaccinated, etc. <br>
By running the queries in the given CovidDataQueries.sql file, you can see the results of the data exploration.

# DataAnalyticsProjects

This is a project that helped me practice what I have learnt till now relating to Data Analytics. <br>
## Data Exploration on the Covid-19 data which was made publicly available by ourworldindata.org. <br>
I have performed some queries which shows a variety of comparisons between the existing population and the effects of Covid-19 on the population. Effects such as rate of infection and death, the number of people affected, the number of people vaccinated, etc. <br>
By running the queries in the given CovidDataQueries.sql file, you can see the results of the data exploration. <br>

## Data Visualization on the above queries using Tableau <br>
Using the queries from above data exploration and modifying them a bit, a tableau dashboard was made which is showns as a png.<br>

## Nashville Housing data to perform data cleaning <br>
The data was raw, using SQL the records were modified to help an analyst perform data analysis on it. The NULL records were dealt using joins and the Y/N were converted to Yes/No since both formats exists in the data. <br>

## Correlation of gross earnings in the movies dataset <br>
Using python and libraries such as numpy, pandas, seaborn and matplotlib; I found out that the budget and votes have the highest correlation with the gross earnings for a movie. <br>

## Making a PowerBI dashboard <br>
Used SQL and PowerBI to filter and make columns which help us analyse the revenue and trends of a hotel business by creating a dashboard with the filtered data.
